v0.3.0
------
Observable API changed: In 0.2 Li.observable could take any function or object and could make it a publisher.
Li.observable is now removed and the ability to make any arbitrary object, a publisher, has been thus removed.
Now Li.Observable (note the capital 'O') is a class that must be inherited to make a class/function a publisher.
One can still make instances of Li.Observable and add properties to it to make arbitrary "publisher objects".
